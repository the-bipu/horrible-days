    This is a <a href="https://svelte.dev/docs/kit">SvelteKit</a> app. I created
    it for people who want to share their terrible experiences—whether about their
    day or any situation. Initially, I made this app for myself when I was having
    a horrible day and regretted being too shy to express my feelings. Then, I realized
    I wasn't the only one who has faced such moments, so I decided to make it public.
    Now, anyone can share their experiences here, and the best part is that it's
    completely anonymous—no one is watching you.
